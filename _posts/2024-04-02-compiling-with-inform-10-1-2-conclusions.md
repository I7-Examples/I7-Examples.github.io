title:  Compiling with Inform 10.1.2 (conclusions)

Due to a combination of compiler problems and lack of compatible extensions, only Damnatio Memoriae and Glass can be compiled and published with Inform 10.1.2.

Although When in Rome 1 and When in Rome 2 can be compiled, publication fails due to generation of invalid file names for the story files.

Since no further release of Inform has appeared since August 2022, I have reverted to using build 6M62.
