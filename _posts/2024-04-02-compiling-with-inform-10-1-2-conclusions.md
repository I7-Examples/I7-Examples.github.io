Due to a combination of compiler problems and lack of compatible extensions, only [Damnatio Memoriae](https://github.com/I7-Examples/Damnatio-Memoriae/releases/tag/v8.0.0) and [Glass](https://github.com/I7-Examples/Glass/releases/tag/v4.0.0) can be compiled and published with Inform 10.1.2.

Although [When in Rome 1](https://github.com/I7-Examples/When-in-Rome-1/releases/tag/v5.0.0) and [When in Rome 2](https://github.com/I7-Examples/When-in-Rome-2/releases/tag/v4.0.0) can be compiled, publication fails due to generation of invalid file names for the story files.

Since no further release of Inform has appeared since August 2022, I have reverted to using build 6M62.
