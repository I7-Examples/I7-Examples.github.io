Due to a combination of compiler bugs and lack of compatible extensions, only [Damnatio Memoriae](https://github.com/I7-Examples/Damnatio-Memoriae/releases/tag/v8.0.0) and [Glass](https://github.com/I7-Examples/Glass/releases/tag/v4.0.0) can be compiled with Inform 10.1.2.

_**As at this date, this is also the situation with Inform 10.2.0-beta.**_
