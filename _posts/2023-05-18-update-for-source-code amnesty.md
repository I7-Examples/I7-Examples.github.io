I've updated the Community Examples page in response to [IF Source Code Amnesty Day](http://blog.zarfhome.com/2023/03/april-1-is-if-source-code-amnesty-day.html).

From now on, I'll gradually work my way through the source code examples on IFDB identifying which examples were produced using which I7 compiler builds and whether or not I have succeeded in recompiling them.
