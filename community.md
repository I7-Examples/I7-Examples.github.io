I've decided to list these according to the I7 build used to produce their latest release. For those of us who are interested in such things, this should make it obvious which of these examples can be easily recompiled and which of them may require extra effort.

_I think this is important because source code examples are more useful to me if they compile. If I reuse code from a compiling example and my efforts don't compile, it's obvious that it's my efforts that are the problem and not the code example. Of course, this is more of an issue for examples developed using older versions of the Inform 7 compiler._

An archive of old releases of Inform 7 is [available here](https://ganelson.github.io/inform-website/downloads/) for anyone who wishes to recompile older games. You may also need the [Archive of Inform 7 Extensions](https://github.com/i7/archive). However, this doesn't contain all versions of all extensions.

Many thanks to all the authors who have so generously released their source code to the rest of the IF Community.

[Slouching Towards Bedlam](http://www.peccable.com/if/slouching-10/), by Star Foster and Daniel Ravipinto (2003).

Hosted by [Peccable Productions](http://www.peccable.com/).
This is published as an [Inform 7 website](http://www.peccable.com/if/slouching-10/src/). A single required extension is [provided](http://www.peccable.com/if/slouching-10/Titled%20Menus.i7x) but the version is the one required to support [Release 1](http://www.peccable.com/if/slouching-10/src-release-1/) which was developed using I7 build 6G60.

_It is quite straightforward to update the extension. Once this is done, the release 2 source code can be compiled using I7 build 6L02._
