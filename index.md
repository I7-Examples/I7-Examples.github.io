Back in the era of I7 Build 6G60, there was [a page on inform7.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20150407084231/http://inform7.com:80/learn/complete-examples/) which presented six games along with their source text. These "standard examples" provided a useful introduction to the features and capabilities of Inform 7.

The same page on inform7.com provided [a link to ifdb.tads.org](https://ifdb.tads.org/search?searchfor=tag:I7%20source%20available) which searched for games written in Inform 7 for which the complete source text had been released. Many of these "community examples" were also of great interest.

However, Inform 7 has moved on since most these examples were written. The source text no longer compiles and this limits their usefulness. I think it would be interesting and instructive to update these games so that they compile when using the latest version of Inform 7.
